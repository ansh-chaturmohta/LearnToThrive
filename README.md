# Learn To Thrive


Learn To Thrive is an organisation by students of IIT Kharagpur, with an aim to to maintain continuity among college students who are passionate and ambitious for learning. Initially started by 2 students of IIT Kharagpur, later recruited many more IITians to be a part of this as well. I was one of them who taught college students various things and during my time there I also made this website for the organisation.
